### What I hope to learn and do 
To get a better understanding of how to use data visualizations in a professional environment, while keeping it engaging and pretty!I hope to improve my ability to convey ideas using these vizualizations. Communication is key in every aspect of your professional life, and hopefully this course will help me improve my communication skills. Lastly, I hope to have a bit of fun and as they say in India, wake up my creative "Keeda"!

### OECD data visualization
[Click here to go to the OECD visualizations page](OECD.md)

This page contains different visualization of the same dataset; https://data.oecd.org/gga/general-government-debt.htm. The visualizations were made with rawgraphs.io
The dataset shows the general government debt in % of GDP of various countries during a period of around 20 years. The first bar chart shown is a chart made avaiable by the Economic co-operation and Development organization. Further visualizations are of my own work, these include a beeswarm plot, and a boxplot. The beeswarm plot uses distinct ‘bubbles’ per year.I was interested in showing the change of debt to %GDP, so I chose to euse a boxplot to do that, which gives an interesting view on the datarange of the various countries’ debts. Enjoy looking around!
