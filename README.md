### About me
Namaste! My name is Akshata Punganur, I'm currently a Master's in Information Systems Management student in the Business Intelligence and Data Analytics track. I have a work experience of over two years as an analyst in the financial sector. Most of my professional experience can be found on my [LinkedIn Profile](linkedin.com/in/akshatapunganur), which I encourage you to check out!

### What I hope to learn and do 
To get a better understanding of how to use data visualizations in a professional environment, while keeping it engaging and pretty!I hope to improve my ability to convey ideas using these vizualizations. Communication is key in every aspect of your professional life, and hopefully this course will help me improve my communication skills. Lastly, I hope to have a bit of fun and as they say in India, wake up my creative "Keeda"!
