# Final project - Tourism and the Environment - part 1 

### Project outline & proposal
Tourism has always been – from a historical perspective – a societal response to the human need for
wellbeing and personal development, through interaction with other people and the environment.
Globally, demand for tourism and recreation opportunities has grown steadily over the last decades and
tourism development, beyond its contribution to national economies, is a major driving force that
impacts essential environmental assets (air, water, biodiversity, soil, land), both in tourist destinations
(locally) and on a global scale.

Tourism is of major importance to European economies, but a damaged environment could undermine
tourism in the future, because tourism needs a clean and attractive environment. Therefore, it is
necessary to monitor and measure the impact of tourism on the environment, and implement tourismrelated policies to ensure greater sustainability of the sector.

### Story Arc
#### Europe Tourism and its impact on environment -
Europe is the world’s primary tourist destination, largely due to its combined natural and cultural attractiveness, as well as other economic and social features. 
 
Tourism is of major importance to European economies, but a damaged environment could undermine tourism in the future, because tourism needs a clean and attractive environment. Therefore, it is necessary to monitor and measure the impact of tourism on the environment, and implement tourismrelated policies to ensure greater sustainability of the sector. 
 
#### Promoting sustainability of tourism - 
At the European level, tourism policy is mainly focussed on the competitiveness of the sector worldwide, while tourism- and environment-related policies in Europe are not about specific legislation and targets. All environmental aspects and references to the sustainability challenges of the tourism sector (which includes tourist accommodation establishments, food and beverage establishments, tourism-related transport, recreational activities, travel agencies, tour operators, etc.) are fragmented and dispersed across sector-based policies and the acquis communautaire. At the same time, many EU environmental sector-based policies, such as those on waste, water, terrestrial and marine biodiversity, air, soil and climate change, identify tourism as a sector whose environmental sustainability is becoming more and more essential. 
 

### Choosing the methodology 
For the purpose of the final project, I will be creating a page using shorthand as a platform. 
I will use a combination of rawgraphs.io, datawrapper.de and tableau as visualization tools, as well as Adobe Illustrator for possible final touches & other visualizations that I deem neccessary to convey the story.

### Finding datasets:
The datasets are mainly for the reader to understand the imoact of tourism on environment and how it can be made sustainable. For this, we'll first analyze and see the tourism trffic in Europe to assimilate the extent of the issue.
Then we see the impact of tourism on the environment

# Part II: final project
I decided to increase the scope of the project after thinking about it and initial feedback from my peers. The story now consists of four elements; the tourism market in Europe, how it has grown because of influence of social media, the impact it has on water and air pollution and lastly, measures taken to make tourism sustainable. 

### target audience
My target audience are people with some general knowledge or experience with visualizations, and those who are able to or want to think critically. I would say my target audience also understands effects of tourism on the environment and importance of necessary steps to be taken in order to make tourism a sustainable source of income and recreation.  

### in-detail storyboard
Please note that this is just an indicator of the final version of the project, and the data visualizations/sources/text area's are not final (as I will probably be making changes during this&following weeks). The website was used as a storyboard visualisation for my interviewees.

#### Visualizations
I sketched the four main visualizations for the key two parts of my story. In the sketches, the information regarding the titles/lables/sources is less relevant to me than the type of visualization, and wether it supports the visualization. These will therefore not be included in the questions for the interviewees.

I decided to show the difference in acceptance rate using a barchart, and the simpsons paradox by showcasing the correlation between acceptance rate per department and percentage of female applicants. These wireframes will be shown to my interview audience with the key question being; does it support the story?


There are 3 key takeaways in the story. 
The first being: 
#### False stories are sometimes created by forgetting to think about statistics or data. 

The second key takeaway is: 
#### Data can sometimes give rise to a story which might not be in line with reality. 

The last takeaway is: 
#### When visualizations are used to create a story, one should think about why the creator is trying to tell that story. 

With the final message being: 
#### Stories, data and visualizations do not always allign or create a picture of reality. In the end, you are responsible for thinking for yourself and creating that picture of reality.

#### roughly the story I told the interviewees: 
Today we're looking at a story which has been supoorted by visualizations - It's with respect to sustainable tourism focusing on Europe.
Part 1 - Why Europe has been chosen.
Part 2 - Ever increasing source of recretion, with aid of social media.
Part 3 - Effects it has on the environment.
Part 4 - Mitigation actions and precautions taken.

## user-research protocol
The key aspects I will try to uncover during the interviews are
	Do the examples in the story fit the story? 
	Do the visualizations add value to the story?
	What might be confusing about the visualizations?
	What would you have done differently in these visualisations? 
	Do you feel like there is a clear message at the end of the story? 
	
I start my interview by stating the following questions: 
//I'm going to tell you a story which is supported by visualizations, could you tell me how and in what these graphics help underline the story?

Follow-up questions might be: 
//What part of the graphics were confusing to you? 
//If you were to retell this story, what would you change? 


## individual interview 1
//I'm going to tell you a story which is supported by visualizations, could you tell me how and in what these graphics help underline the story?

Response: 1st visualization - does bring out the 51% share Europe has for all tourist arrivals and brings out the point in the first instance.

2nd visualization - The comparison of tourist arrivals between 2000 and 2016 cn be done on the same axis instead of two different for quicker understanding.

3rd visualiaztion - The cameras are a little distracting since they are different, try using the same camera in different colors.

4th visualization - you can combine rail if they are not of too much significance and you donot intend to highlight those. Use of colors for Marine and road are apt and increasing trend of marine is highlighted.

5th visualization - You need to separate the graphs and increase the intensity of the red color. if excellent quality of water is not your focus you can choose to exclude it from the graph.

6th visualization - you should go ahead with the geospatial depiction of certificates issued, you started with the globalmap and are concluding focusing on a particular area with a particular conclusion.

## individual interview 2
//I'm going to tell you a story which is supported by visualizations, could you tell me how and in what these graphics help underline the story?

Response: A similar reaaction for the first two visualizations. The 3rd visualization was appreciated.
For air pollution (4th visualization) it would be better to increase the font of the axis.
For bathing water quality (5th visualization) the grey is being ignored. otherwise it is a good representation.

All your visualizations do have a flow and are relevant to the story you are telling.


## individual interview 3
//I'm going to tell you a story which is supported by visualizations, could you tell me how and in what these graphics help underline the story?

Response: 
	'what do you mean by stories?'. 

(In regards to the first 'question') So that means the reverse is true too?Since its true on 'both ' sides, it is not really controversial. The face value makes it look like its shallow, but is isnt really. The 'one out of twenty people ' is a good visualization to showcase this. 

The bellcurve is fitting. I understand that.

(When looking at tableau version of the correlation graph) What do the sizes mean? Too many things. X y and size is confusing. 
	Maybe break it up into two graphs? 

A bar graph again might be better. Per deparment the acceptance rate of women. 
	The graph is unclear. Doesn't support the story very well. You have to look at it for a while. 

The whole story is a bit confusing. I understand what you're saying. 

Show both women and men acceptance rates are the same per department then you can see it better. 

## Insights for changes made to sketches, storyboards & wireframes
Well.. I'm not happy with the results. My story all over the place and my interviewees have had a hard time understanding the storyline. I feared this might be the case since I'm trying to convey multiple messages at once, and coming up with a frankensteins' monster of a conclusion. This isn't working right now, so things have to change. 

In order to fit my project within the timeframe of the final presentation, I've been struggling with keeping the stories short and to the point. The problem is, since they're 'paradoxes' and 'fallacies', they are inherently tough to understand even for an educated audience. This caused my story to be going from left to right, jumping from assumptions to conlusions.The process of trying to streamline this has not been an enjoyable one, and I've been spending most of my time finding obscure examples which might fit both the story and the timeframe. In the full project on shorthand I will have the chance to underline my thoughts and assumptions, but in the presentation I will not. 

The main change will be that I will be completely separating my final project and my presentation. I will create a seperate page on shorthand for the presentation which will focus on only ONE example. This page will be included (the content will be copied) to my main shorthand page for the project. *The 1973 Berkeley case will now be my main focus for the project & presentation* in order to make it a coherent story. 

Changes that will be made to the project and presentation:
- Presentation: 
	- The berkeley 1973 admittance rate case will be the prime subject of my presentation. I have chosen this because I think this case showcases the underlying thought I'm trying to convey the best. My project story arc will have a different ending message than the presentation. I am thinking of using the famous 'There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics' line popularized my Mark Twain as my ending message for the presentation. This fits the apparent Simpsons Paradox well. 
	- I should no longer define it as statistics in the presentation story arc. I can explain this in the project, and I should define the relationship between statistics, data, visualizations and storytelling. 
	
- Project: 
	- I need to vocalize the various assumptions I make better, and showcase that I'm showing examples not 'truths'.  
	- In order to show the relationship between a data and a story, I need to visualize this. This is mainly for the presentation, as my audience needs to quickly grasp that they don't allign at all times.  
	- For the project I will take the time to type out the assumptions, as I want the final project to read like a well thought out article. 
	- I'm thining to completely remove the other story arcs and focussing on just the one, and maybe looking at how it is now (2019). 
	
Visualizations:
	- The bell curve for the first part of the story seems to work. I'm keeping this in together with the '1 in 20' visualization. 
	- The bar graph for the Berkeley case needs to be supported by numbers to make it more clear what it showcases. I will add a table in the graph
	- Sources needs to be properly added to the final versions which will be made in Tableau
	- Titles needs to be improved upon for all visualizations to tell the story. The reader goes from reading the title to trying to understand the graph, I need to focus on that. 
	- The current visualization for the negative correlation between female applicants and acceptance rate is unclear. I need to split up what I'm trying to say and make more clear what the axis are. I have a hard time explaining it, that means that the audience will have an even harder time grasping it. 


I have focussed on improving the visualizations to support the Berkeley case as this will be the key part of my presentation. I'm still working on the improvements but I'm very happy with the results so far. This is how I've changed the correlation graph to an actual story:
